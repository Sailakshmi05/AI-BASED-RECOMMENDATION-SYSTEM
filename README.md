*AI-based recommendation systems play a crucial role in providing personalized and relevant content, products, and services to users. In Java, tools like Apache Mahout, Weka, Deeplearning4j, and TensorFlow Java allow developers to build effective recommendation systems using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods. These systems are widely used across industries such as e-commerce, streaming, social media, education, and advertising to improve user engagement, satisfaction, and retention by delivering tailored experiencesApache Mahout is a machine learning library that is widely used for building recommendation systems, clustering, classification, and other machine learning tasks. It provides built-in algorithms for collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, making it a great tool for building recommendation systems.Once the system is trained and tested, it can be deployed in production, where it can interact with real-time data and provide recommendations to users.*
